# Ocean Biodiversity Datasets 🌎🐳

The volume of oceanic data is staggering - in 2018 we collected more ocean data then in the entire previous century! ([Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01668-z), [Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2019.00440/full)). Unfortunately, it's scattered across different organisations and data formats, which makes it not easily accessible.

🚀 **Our Mission:**
Our mission is to **enable comprehensive understanding of nature** and **align human activities** with it, starting with **oceans**. To get there we need:

- Enable **comprehensive modeling**: train **foundation models for biodviersity** -- large-scale multi-modal AI models specifically tailored for modelling biosphere.
- **Accelerate research and decisions**: provide data tools and analytics against ocean biodiversity data to accelerate research and decision-making to protect nature.
